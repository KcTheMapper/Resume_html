            <h2>Education</h2>
            <h3>The University of Texas at Austin</h3>
            <h4>Graduated May 2017</h4>
            <h3>Double Major: <strong>Geography</strong> (GIS) and <strong>Spanish </strong>(Literature)</h3>
            <p>
                    I was able to pursue my interest in literature through Spanish and refine my knack for analysis
                    in Geography. Seeking expertise in spatial analysis, I was disciplined in location-allocation,
                    network analysis, and site selection. I sought extra-curricular experiences where I was able to
                    analyze LiDAR tiles and understand the basics of database management. My studies culminated
                    in a semester abroad in Santiago, Chile. I collaborated with Chileans in their native language as I
                    learned biogeography, poetry, and hydrogeography modeling.
